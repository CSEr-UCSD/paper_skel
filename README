The supplied Makefile uses a LaTeX build system called rubber,
which _greatly_ simplifies the build process.  The hard way (multiple
pdflatex/bibtex incantations) will also work. rubber is available at

  http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/


To build this paper, you'll want to symlink in the "ref.bib" and "rfc.bib"
files from dave's biblio repository.  You can check those out of the
subversion repository at

  https://moo.cmcl.cs.cmu.edu/svn/biblio/

A note:  The given Makefile tries to ensure that all fonts are embedded.
You can double-check by running 'pdffonts' on the final paper.pdf or an
individual figure.
